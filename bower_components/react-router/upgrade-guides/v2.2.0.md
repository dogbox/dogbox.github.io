# v2.2.0 Upgrade Guide

## `getComponent`, `getComponents` signature

**This is unlikely to affect you, even if you use `getComponent` and `getComponents`.**

The signature of `getComponent` and `getComponents` has been changed from `(location: Location, callback: Function) => any` to `(nextState: RouterState, callback: Function) => any`. That means that instead of writing

```js
getComponent(location, cb) {
  cb(fetchComponent(location.query))
}
```

You would instead need to write

```js
getComponent(nextState, cb) {
  cb(fetchComponent(nextState.location.query))
}
```

However, you now also have access to the matched `params` on `nextState`, and can use those to determine which component to return.

You will still be able to access location properties directly on `nextState` until the next breaking release (and in fact they will shadow router state properties, if applicable), but this will cause a deprecation warning in development mode.
